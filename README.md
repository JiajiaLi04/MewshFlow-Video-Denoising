We Proposed an efficient video denoising approach by utilizing the MESHFLOW motion model for the camera motion compensation
The meshflow is a sparse motion field. It is used to estimate motions between neighboring frames, which are used to align frames within a sliding time window. This method could achieve strong denoising results under a very fast speed and is robust to different types of camera motions and scene types.
